            <p>Did you know that a meadow can support all kind of wildlife?</p>
            <p>It's true, even leaving a small patch of your garden to grow wild can benefit all kind of pollinators, butterflies, caterpillars.</p>
            <p>If just a small proportion of our gardens and public green spaces in the UK could be left alone, our wildlife would gain so much.</p>
            <p>Bristol-based campaigner, Martin Cordey, is trying to raise awareness of this issue in his home town and thanks to his hard work, Bristol City Council are leaving many open green spaces to grow wild. Martin's been delighted with the response.</p>
            <p>With pollinating insects in decline across the UK, it's Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Saepe, id?</p>
            <blockquote>"It's buzzing!"</blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Read more about Martin's campaign <a href="https://www.change.org/p/to-all-councils-and-authorities-say-no-to-the-mow-let-nature-thrive-stop-cutting-verges-and-grass-in-open-spaces" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
            <p>Gardening with wildlife in mind is gaining popularity here in the UK. Whether it's creating a small pond, growing herbs, creating a mini-meadow, or just keeping those bird feeders topped up, us Brits have really taken this theme to heart.</p>
            <p>With many households in the UK not fortunate enough to have their own garden, we asked wildlife gardening expert Kate Bradbury for ideas. "It's so easy to get involved," said Kate. "Most people don't realise that even something as simple as
                allowing 'weeds' such as dandelions to thrive will benefit our pollinators. A friend of mine recently planted one small hanging basket with some lavender, and within minutes of hanging it up, the bees were buzzing. Helping nature is so
                rewarding, and you don't need a big garden to make a difference. Growing a pot of herbs or creating a mini-pond out of an old sink, the list is endless!"</p>
            <p>We love Kate's passion for nature and think her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2015/may/12/dandelions-pollinators-wildlife-garden" target="_blank">gardening blog</a> is well worth a look. </p>
